        summary: "We share our hands-on methodology for maximizing brand-specific video consistency using proprietary LoRA-based finetuning.",
        sections: [
          { heading: "1. Why Finetuning Matters", body: "The biggest challenge in generating videos with generative AI is brand consistency. No matter how carefully you craft prompts, general-purpose models cannot accurately reproduce a brand's unique colors, logo placement, and tone-of-voice. By applying finetuning techniques like LoRA and DreamBooth, you can train a brand's visual identity into the model so that outputs always follow brand guidelines. Loomix AI has embedded this technology into LX Engine, automatically applying it to every project." },
          { heading: "2. LX Engine Finetuning Workflow", body: "LX Engine finetuning follows four stages. First, brand asset collection — logos, color palettes, fonts, and existing video references are gathered. Second, training data refinement — brand DNA is extracted from collected assets and optimized into a training dataset. Third, custom model training — LoRA techniques inject brand characteristics into the base model. Average training time is 2–4 hours at no additional cost. Fourth, quality verification — brand consistency scores are automatically measured on test videos, and models are deployed only after achieving 95% or above." },
          { heading: "3. The Path to 96% Brand Consistency", body: "Loomix AI has completed over 200 finetuning projects, continuously improving brand consistency scores. Starting from an initial 89%, through refined data preparation processes and multi-layer LoRA application, we now record an average consistency score of 96%. This means that when generating 10 videos for the same brand, the color palette, composition, and tone are indistinguishable from each other to the human eye." },
          { heading: "4. Case Study: D2C Beauty Brand", body: "After applying LX Engine finetuning to D2C beauty brand Company A, first-draft brand fit improved dramatically. Before finetuning, an average of 3.2 revision requests occurred per project; after finetuning, this dropped to 0.6 (an 80% reduction). This directly shortened production lead times from 10 days to 3 days per project. Company A's marketing director commented, 'It feels like the AI truly understands our brand.'" },
          { heading: "5. Finetuning Adoption Checklist", body: "If you're considering finetuning adoption, verify the following. First, are brand assets organized? — CI/BI guides and at least 10 existing video references are needed. Second, is consistency critical? — Effects are maximized in series campaigns and repeat production rather than one-off videos. Third, set appropriate expectations — finetuning isn't a silver bullet, and 1–2 rounds of model tuning iterations may be needed for optimal results. Loomix AI offers free consultations to assess finetuning suitability." },

        sections: [
          { heading: "Test Background and Methodology", body: "The AI video generation market includes various general-purpose models like Sora, Runway Gen-3, and Pika. Loomix AI conducted a comparative test using 10 actual client projects, comparing results from general-purpose models alone vs. LX Engine (with finetuning applied). Five evaluation criteria were used: brand consistency, visual quality, prompt accuracy, generation speed, and number of revisions needed." },
          { heading: "Brand Consistency Comparison", body: "When generating brand videos with general-purpose models, color reproduction sits at 70–80%, and logo placement and tone-of-voice consistency varies with each generation. LX Engine, through finetuning that pre-learns brand assets, recorded 96% color reproduction and 94% tone consistency. Particularly when sequentially generating 10 videos for a series campaign, general-purpose models showed high variance requiring manual correction, while LX Engine outputs were immediately usable without additional adjustments." },
          { heading: "Visual Quality and Generation Speed", body: "For a 30-second 1080p video, Sora averaged 8 minutes, Runway Gen-3 took 12 minutes, and LX Engine completed in 6 minutes. In terms of visual quality, Sora excelled in realistic expression, while Runway was strong in stylized videos. LX Engine showed the highest completion rate for brand-specific videos, with a 'ready to use on first generation' rate of 78% — the highest among all models (Sora 34%, Runway 41%)." },
          { heading: "Conclusion: When to Use General vs. Finetuned Models", body: "General-purpose models are suitable for concept validation, initial prototyping, and one-off creative experiments. For brand campaigns, series content, and repeat production, finetuned LX Engine holds the advantage in time, cost, and quality across the board. Loomix AI selectively combines general-purpose models and LX Engine based on project characteristics to deliver optimal results." },

In customer service, they serve as 24/7 multilingual AI agents; in education, as personalized tutors; and in marketing, as brand ambassadors. In specialized fields like finance and healthcare, AI avatars trained on experts' faces and voices deliver highly credible content." },

First, active executive support and change management—addressing team anxieties about AI and positioning it as an 'augmentation' rather than 'replacement' tool. Second, data-driven gradual expansion—proving results with a small pilot before scaling step by step to minimize risk. Third, thorough brand guideline AI training—systematically teaching brand assets and tone-of-voice early on to ensure consistent quality." },
